# Language:       cat
# Web site:       https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/
# Last tested on: Ubuntu 22.04.1
# Requires:       The "coreutils" package is pre-installed

# NOTE: This is cheating; "cat" is not really a scripting language,
# This depends on the existence of the expected-output.txt file
# (provided with this project) in the parent directory (the test
# is run in a temporary subdirectory)
