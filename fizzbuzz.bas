1 REM Language:       BASIC
2 REM Web site:       http://www.bwbasic.at/info.htm
3 REM Last tested on: Ubuntu 20.04
4 REM Requires:       apt-get install bwbasic
5 REM NOTE:           bwBASIC actually supports a structured IF/THEN/ELSE
6 REM                 statement, but I decided to use old-style line numbers
7 REM                 and GOTO statements for the sake of nostalgia.
8 REM NOTE:           There doesn't seem to be a way to tell bwbasic not to
9 REM                 print a copyright header and a trailing blank line, so
10 REM                the verify script filters them out.
